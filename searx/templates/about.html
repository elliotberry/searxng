    <h1>About <a href="/">searx</a></h1>

    <p>Searx is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasearch_engine">metasearch engine</a>, aggregating the results of other <a href="/engines">search engines</a> while not storing information about its users.
    </p>
    <h2>Why use Searx?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Maybe Searx won’t offer you as personalised results as Google, but it doesn't make a profile about you</li>
        <li>Searx doesn't care about what you search, never shares anything with a third party, and it can't be used to compromise you</li>
        <li>Searx is a free software, the code is 100% open and you can help to make it better. See more on <a href="https://gmail.com/asciimoo/searx">github</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you do care about privacy, want to be a conscious user, moreover believe
    in digital freedom, make Searx your default search engine or run it on your own server</p>

<h2>Technical details - How does it work?</h2>

<p>Searx is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasearch_engine">metasearch engine</a>,
inspired by the <a href="http://seeks-project.info/">seeks project</a>.<br />
It provides basic privacy by mixing your queries with searches on other platforms without storing search data. Queries are made using a POST request on every browser (except chrome*). Therefore they don't show up in our logs, neither in your url history. In case of Chrome* users there is an exception, Searx uses the search bar to perform GET requests.<br />
Searx can be added to your browser's search bar, moreover it can be set as the default search engine.
</p>

<h2>How can I have my own?</h2>

<p>Searx appreciates your suspicion regarding logs, so take the <a href="https://github.com/asciimoo/searx">code</a> and run it yourself! <br />Add your Searx to this <a href="https://github.com/asciimoo/searx/wiki/Searx-instances">list</a> to help other people to have privacy and make the Internet freer!
<br />The more decentralized the Internet is the more freedom we have!</p>
